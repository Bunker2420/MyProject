Ruthwick Shop is a project I built as part of my full-stack development journey, inspired by the Amazon UI. It was created to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on development.

This project features a beautifully styled and fully responsive:

🏠 Home Page

📦 Order Page

🧾 Checkout Page

🚚 Order Tracking Page

Using JavaScript, I implemented dynamic features such as payment calculations, real-time updates, and basic form handling to simulate an e-commerce experience. The focus was on building clean layouts, smooth UI transitions, and understanding DOM manipulation and events.

Ruthwick Shop represents my first step into creating interactive, user-focused web applications, and lays the foundation for my transition into full-stack development.
